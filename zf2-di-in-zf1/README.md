##Use Zend\Di in Zend Framework v1 application##

### What? ###
Quick example to illustrate one possible way to use Zend\Di from Zend Framework 2 in your existing Zend_Application-based Zend Framework 1.x site. 

### Why? ###
Zend Framework 2.0.0dev3 was released this week with a first official look at the Dependency Injection component; I figured i'd spend some time kicking it's tires, and this is the result.
